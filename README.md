# foundryvtt-never-pause

This module automatically unpauses foundry upon the game world being made ready.

**This module is intended for personal use only. Depend on this at your own risk.**

## Why do this?

- I trust my players to not mess with the scenes when not in use.
- If I need my players to not touch tokens, I'll move them to another scene.
- Players may have a want or need to configure the prototype token while the game is paused.
- I don't like keeping track of pause states.
